Thank you to use Pombo!

Then you will need to:
	1 - import your GnuPG keyID (may need to restart your session before)
	2 - tune options into pombo.conf (you can use the GUI: pombo-config)
	3 - tune variables into pombo.php
	4 - copy pombo.php to your server(s) (both PHP versions 4 & 5 supported)


And do not forget to write somewhere in security your computer Serial Number.
